# Microstrip Patch Antenna — 2.45 GHz Geometry Comparison

Comparative study of five microstrip patch antenna geometries (circular, F-shaped, triangular, square, hexagonal) operating at 2.45 GHz. Each design was simulated in CST Studio Suite, fabricated on FR-4 substrate, and measured with a Rohde & Schwarz VNA.

## Results

### Simulation (CST Studio)

All five geometries were modeled in CST Studio Suite before fabrication. Each antenna was simulated at 2.45 GHz to evaluate return loss, impedance matching, bandwidth, and radiation characteristics. The 3D models, S11 plots, VSWR curves, radiation patterns, and far-field views are available in [`simulation-and-results.pdf`](docs/simulation-and-results.pdf). The CST VBA macros that build each antenna from scratch are in the [`cst/`](cst/) directory.

### Simulation vs. Measurement

| Geometry   | S11 sim (dB) | S11 meas (dB) | ΔS11 (dB) | VSWR sim | VSWR meas | ΔVSWR |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Circular   | −53.08      | −31.99       | +21.09    | 1.004    | 1.125     | +0.121 |
| F-shaped   | −30.02      | −16.98       | +13.04    | 1.065    | 1.167     | +0.102 |
| Triangular | −18.86      | −15.37       | +3.49     | 1.257    | 1.368     | +0.111 |
| Square     | −16.38      | −14.46       | +1.92     | 1.357    | 1.536     | +0.179 |
| Hexagonal  | −14.78      | −13.93       | +0.85     | 1.446    | 1.694     | +0.248 |

Circular patch came out on top in both simulation and measurement. All five designs cleared the S11 < −10 dB threshold, confirming acceptable impedance matching at 2.45 GHz. The ranking held across simulation and measurement, though measured return loss was consistently higher (worse) than simulated. The largest delta appeared in the circular patch (21 dB), likely because its deep simulated null is sensitive to any real-world imperfection. Probable error sources include SMA connector parasitics, FR-4 permittivity variation (manufacturer spec: 4.2–4.8, simulation used 4.4), etching undercut reducing trace accuracy, and soldering losses at the SMA–feed junction.

## Fabricated Antennas

Each geometry was fabricated on FR-4 with SMA connectors — two samples per design.
